# ELECTIONS-JAVASWING
This is a JAVA Swing Desktop Application allowing to manage elections. Achieving this goal means 
managing the parties that run for office, the voters, the polling stations and the results.
* A Party is characterized by: its name, its symbol, its president, its number of members,
etc.
* A Voter is characterized by his name and surname, his CIN, his age, the number of the office where he has to vote, his situation (if he has voted or not yet), his choice (the symbol of the chosen party when he has voted), his 
situation (if he has voted or not yet), his choice (the symbol of the party chosen when he voted) 
voted), etc.
* An office is characterized by its number, its address, its region (character string), etc.

Knowing that we want to manage all the parties participating in the elections, all the voters, all the polling stations and the results of the elections, we ask you to implement an all the polling stations and the results of the elections, we ask you to implement a java application. This application must display a menu allowing :
* Voter management: It includes the registration of new voters (knowing that they must be at least 18 years old), the posting of the list of voters by polling station must be at least 18 years old), the posting of the list of voters by polling station, the posting of the display of the polling station number of a given voter of CIN, the completion of the voter (which means that he/she has to enter the symbol of the party he/she has chosen and to color his/her finger (to change his/her situation), etc.
* Party management: It includes the addition of a new party, the modification of a given party 
(name of the president, number of members, ...), the display of the list of parties, the display of a party with a given symbol, etc.
* The management of the polling stations: It includes adding a new office, modifying the information of an office, displaying information of a polling station, displaying the list of polling stations, displaying the total number of registered voters per polling station, displaying the number of registered voters who have voted, etc.
* Results management: It includes the generation and display of results in 2 possible forms 
possible: the number of votes per party and the percentage of votes obtained by each party. These results can be calculated and displayed :
  * either by polling station
  * or globally for all the polling stations
  * Other results can be proposed, such as: the winning party of the elections (the one that 
(the one that obtained the maximum number of votes), the parties that did not obtain any votes, etc.
* Statistics: The application can offer some statistics such as the voting rate  (percentage of registered voters who participated in the vote) overall, by region and by age group. It is also possible to refine the results by age group of voters, etc.

For more details, see these two PDFs; the first one explain what must the application offer as services and the second one shows the final result:</br>[Projet POO 2019.pdf](https://github.com/Trabelsi-Development/ELECTIONS-JAVASWING/files/9002851/Projet.POO.2019.pdf)</br>[Rapport2019.pdf](https://github.com/Trabelsi-Development/ELECTIONS-JAVASWING/files/9002877/Rapport2019.pdf)
